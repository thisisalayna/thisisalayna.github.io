    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<br>When I was younger, I told myself that I was going to be a professional artist when I grew up. Admittedly, I was drawing with crayons at the time, but I had a gut feeling that I had to become an artist. After high school, I attended my local community college to obtain an Associate Degree in Graphic Design. While I enjoyed my time there, and I appreciated the fact that I got a job at a local but nationally well-known company that specializes in screen printed heat transfers, I knew I wanted more variety. While I love design, I have always enjoyed computers, whether it is browsing on the internet or building a computer for the first time. I knew I wanted a Bachelor's degree, but to get another degree in graphic design specifically felt redundant, and as though I wasn't aiming high enough for myself. Design is a passion of mine, but I strived for something more. I had motion design in mind, but I wasn’t sure if that was entirely what I wanted, depending on the degree I pursued. That is when I came across the Digital Media Art program at San Jose State. What drew me to Digital Media Art the strongest was the variety of subjects that the program covers. Of the wide range of subjects taught, 3D printing & modelling, game design, artificial intelligence and machine learning appealed to me the most. It didn’t hurt that Motion Graphics is also a possible career path for digital media artists. With technology being a defining factor of my generation, it feels only fitting to use it to create art, both physical and digital. I consider myself to be an artist, yet outside of that, many areas of digital media art fascinate me. Something that I have always aimed to do as a designer has been to create positive messaging about a topic, even if the topic could be considered dark in nature. Bringing awareness to anything important but in a positive light is something I enjoy doing, because while a specific topic can be difficult to think about, it is important to me to bring awareness to the constructive aspects of it, such as how endangered animals are important to the environment and why we should protect them, or why art is an important tool for children to have in society, whether they end up being artists or not. As a digital media artist, I hope to bring a similar mindset into my three dimensional art. With a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art, I strive to combine the technical and the creative. While I’m constantly debating whether I should work with machine learning, artificial intelligence, game design, 3D printing, or a combination of them all, I hope to provoke entertainment and enjoyment in the viewers or users of the art I create.
